				<h1>About Us</h1> 
				







        <p>The First-Generation Student Alliance (FGSA) at UC San Diego is a student-led organization dedicated to fostering a supportive, inclusive, and empowering community for students who are the first in their families to pursue a college degree. We recognize the unique challenges that first-generation students often face—from navigating unfamiliar academic systems to balancing cultural, familial, and educational expectations—and we aim to provide a space where students can connect, share their experiences, and find resources tailored to their needs.</p>
<p>At FGSA, we believe that being a first-generation college student is not just an identity but a source of strength and pride. We strive to celebrate this identity while helping students overcome the barriers they may encounter in their academic, professional, and personal journeys. Through community-building, mentorship, advocacy, and leadership opportunities, FGSA seeks to uplift first-generation voices and ensure that every student feels seen, supported, and empowered to thrive at UC San Diego.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Our mission is to empower first-generation college students at UC San Diego by creating a welcoming community that fosters connection, belonging, and pride in the first-generation identity. We aim to provide the tools, resources, and networks necessary for students to succeed academically, develop professionally, and grow personally.</p>
<p>Through meaningful programs, collaborative partnerships, and advocacy, we work to address the unique needs and challenges faced by first-generation students. We are committed to raising awareness of the first-generation experience across campus, building alliances with other organizations and departments, and promoting a culture of inclusion and equity that benefits the entire university community.</p>
<p>FGSA strives to equip students not only to navigate college but also to lead, inspire, and create lasting change—both within the university and beyond.</p>


        <h2>What does &quot;first-generation&quot; mean?</h2>
<p>First-generation is an identity, and a quite complex one at that. In its most simple form, being first-generation means you are the first in your family to do something. In higher education it's often used to refer to first-generation college students or first-generation international students, those of whom often experience the most challenges in adjusting to college life. However, you can also be first-generation in your major, field, academia, etc. - there are plenty of other first-generation identities which don't often get talked about. We'd like to highlight the following question from <a href="/faq/">our FAQ</a>:</p>


        
            
        
            
                
                
                        <div class="question">
            <h2>Q: How do I know I am a first-generation student?</h2>
            <p>A: UCSD defines first-generation students as those with with neither parent having a four-year college degree. However, this definition doesn&#39;t tell the full story; you can also be first-gen in the international sense or even other senses! &quot;First-Generation&quot; can be a complex identity, and generally speaking, if you are doing or pursuing something that noone of your family has done before, then that makes you first-generation.</p>
        </div>
            
        
            
        
            
        
            
        
            
        
            
        
            
        

        <p>That answer might not completely satisfy you or answer all of your questions. That's okay! It's a very broad question, and we encourage you to reflect more on what it means to be first-gen, because chances are, you are likely a first-generation student in some capacity.</p>
<p>Here's what being first-gen means to some of us:</p>
